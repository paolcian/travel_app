# Travel App Project

## Overview
This is a project for Udacity nanodegree 'Front End Developer'. This is a Final Project.  
The starter code has been provided by Udacity but I made some changes in all files (index.html, style.css, app.js, server.js).

## Requirements
The requirements were to cretae a web app using all skills I have learned so far at Nanodegree program. The app allows users to create travel plans - when the user submits travel date and destination name, the application displays destination with photos and weather forecast returned from external API. One additional feature has been added to extend the project - possibility to remove the last trip. The following technology has been used:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Express
5. Node
6. Webpack
7. Jest
8. GeoNames API
9. Weatherbit API
10. Pixabay API
